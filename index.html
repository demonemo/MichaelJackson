        <p>Michael joseph Jackson( August 29, 1958- June 25, 2009)was an american singer, songwriter, dancer, philanthropist and was born in Gray Indiana.
            He was regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.
            His contributions to music, dance, and fashion, as well as his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture over a four-decade career.

            </p>
            <p>Michael Joseph Jackson was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. Katherine Esther Jackson (n√©e Scruse), his mother, played clarinet and piano, aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, former boxer Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, worked as a crane operator at US Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout who, according to family legend, was also a Native American medicine man. Michael grew up with three sisters <em><strong>(Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet)</strong> and five brothers <strong>(Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy) Brandon,</strong> Marlon's twin,</em> died shortly after birth.</p>

                The changes to his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery, and his skin tone became much lighter. He was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition, he used fair-colored makeup and likely skin-bleaching prescription creams to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin. The lighter skin resulted in criticism that he was trying to appear white. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not.
                Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father Joe Jackson. In 2003, Joe admitted to whipping them as children, but he emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations.The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health problems later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.
