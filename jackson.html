        <p> The Jackson 5 also known as the Jacksons are a family-based American pop band comprised of members of the Jackson family. The group was formed in 1964 in Gary, Indiana, and consisted for the majority of their career of brothers. Joe Jackson, their father, managed them.The group was one of the first African American performers to gain a mainstrea.</p>

   <p> Joe Jackson, the father of the five Jackson brothers, encouraged their musical interests. Joe discovered Tito playing with his guitar after a string broke in 1964 and was impressed enough to buy him his own guitar. In 1965,<em> Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie</em> formed their own band, with <em>Michael (age 5)</em>on congas and childhood friends Reynaud Jones and Milford Hite on keyboards and drums. When Evelyn LaHaie suggested that the group name itself the Jackson Five Singing Group in August 1965, Marlon joined on tambourine. </p>

        <p>Berry Gordy, Jr., president of Motown Records, was impressed with the group and signed them in 1969. The Jackson 5 became an instant success, sporting the loudest fashions, the largest Afros, the snappiest choreography, and a youthful, soulful exuberance.

        <p>With Michael topping the pop charts as a solo performer with "Ben" and reaching number two with "Rockin' Robin," and the Jackson 5 producing trendsetting dance tracks like "Dancing Machine," the Jackson family's string of Motown hits lasted until 1975. Michael's voice changed as he matured, family tensions arose, and a contract standoff ensued.The Jacksons eventually left Motown and signed with Epic Records as the Jacksons. Jermaine Jackson remained at Motown as a solo artist until he was replaced by his youngest brother, Randy Jackson (in full Steven Randall Jackson; b. October 29, 1961). The Jacksons enjoyed consistent success as a recording act until 1984, and their sister Janet Jackson began her own singing career in the early 1980s; however, Michael's solo albums took on an entirely different status.</p>
